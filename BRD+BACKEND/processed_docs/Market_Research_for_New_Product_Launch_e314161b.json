  "description": "The market research project aims to gather insights on consumer behavior, preferences, and needs to inform the development of a new product. The research methodology includes online surveys, focus groups, and competitor analysis. The target audience is millennials and Gen Z, with a focus on the 18-35 age group. The research objectives are to identify market gaps, determine consumer willingness to pay, and gather feedback on product features and design. The research is expected to be completed within 6 weeks, with a budget of $100,000. The key stakeholders involved are the product management team, design team, and marketing team. The research findings will inform the product development roadmap, with a tentative launch date of 6 months from project initiation. The action items include finalizing the survey questionnaire, recruiting participants, and conducting data analysis. The decision to proceed with the research project has been approved by the executive team, and the project timeline is expected to be reviewed and refined in the upcoming project meeting."
