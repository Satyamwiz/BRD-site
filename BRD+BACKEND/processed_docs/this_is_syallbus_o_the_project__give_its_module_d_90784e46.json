The project is divided into several key modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of the project.\n\nThe primary objective of the project is to generate a JSON object with a specific structure, which includes a title and description. This JSON object will serve as a crucial input for the preparation of a Business Requirements Document (BRD).\n\nThe project requires a careful analysis of the provided content, including email chains, meeting notes, and transcriptions. The analysis will involve identifying key points, decisions, and action items relevant to the project or business process.\n\nThe module details include the generation of a JSON object with a specific structure. The JSON object should have a title, which is a concise one-line summary, and a description, which is an extensive write-up covering all aspects of the analyzed content.\n\nThe project requires adherence to specific guidelines, including ensuring the response is a valid JSON object, with no text before or after the JSON object. The title should be concise, and the description should be extensive, covering all key points, decisions, action items, and relevant information from the document.\""
